Results are in! The median score was 137/150, the average 123/150.  You
can access your final exam score, and your total score and course grade,
as usual at <a href=https://www-s.math.illinois.edu/grades/grades.cgi>

<p>
This has been a wonderful class to teach, and I am glad to have had this
opportunity. I hope you found it an interesting and rewarding
experience. Enjoy the rest of the summer, and all the best on the rest
of your undergraduate studies here at Illinois! 



<h3>
Welcome 
</h3> 

Welcome to Math 347! This course is an introduction to rigorous
mathematical reasoning and proofs, and  a preparation for upper level
proof-based math courses such as Math 417 (Abstract Algebra) or
Math 447 (Real Analysis).  You will learn the fundamental concepts in
mathematics such as sets, functions, and relations,  how to construct a
rigorous mathematical argument (a "proof"), and how to write up the
argument in a clear and logically correct manner.  Along the way, you
will encounter many interesting, "cool" problems from a variety of areas
of mathematics.


<p>
This course is both challenging and rewarding.  It is unlike any other
math course in that its focus is not on any particular mathematical
subject, but rather on general mathematical concepts and abstract
ideas, logical reasoning, and proofs.  The emphasis is not on
memorizing facts and formulas, but on learning precise mathematical
thinking  and logical reasoning.  This course requires a serious
investment of time and effort. 

The analytical and logical skills you acquire in this course not only
prepare you for advanced math courses, but are also useful in the real
world.  Knowing how induction <i>really</i> works, or getting
comfortable with fearsome looking  epsilon-delta definitions that you
may have seen in calculus, but never <i>really</i> understood, can be
deeply gratifying.  You'll come across many interesting mathematical
gems, logical puzzles, and challenging problems that one normally
wouldn't see in other courses.  <p>

I will do my best to help you along the way and make this course an
interesting, enjoyable, and worthwhile experience.  Below is some basic
information about the course; more information  will be posted here as
we move along.   If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions,
feel free to contact me (email ajh@illinois.edu).   I look forward to
working with you over the coming eight weeks, and wish you an
enjoyable, productive, and fulfilling, summer semester! 


<h3> Course Basics</h3>
<ul>

<li><b>Time/Room:</b> MTWRF 10:00 am - 10:50 am, W 9:00 am - 9:50 am, 
141 Altgeld Hall.

<li><b>Instructor:</b> A.J. Hildebrand, 13 Illini Hall,
email <b>ajh@illinois.edu</b>.

<li><b>Office Hours/Open House:</b> I plan to be available daily right after
class (at 11 am) and at 4 pm Wednesdays and Sundays,  in
the regular classroom, 141 Altgeld (if available), or in one of the
neighboring rooms.

<li><b>Text and syllabus:</b>
The official text for Math 347 is "Mathematical Thinking" by D'Angelo
and West (2nd edition).  We will cover Chapters 1-4, 13-14, and
selected topics from the other chapters depending on audience
preferences.  I will supplement this text with handouts summarizing the
key concepts, definitions, and theorems on a given topic, and with
worksheets providing additional, carefully selected practice problems.

<h3>
Course Policies
</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Grading summary:</b> 
Your grade will be determined by the points you have accumulated
at the end of the course.  The <b>approximate</b> breakdown is as follows:

<ul>
<li>
<b>Homework:</b> 200 points.  Two assignments per week, due in class.
The lowest hw score will be dropped. 
<li>
<b>Midterm Exams:</b> 250 points. Three midterms, each worth 100 points, 
but the lowest midterm score will count only 50% (i.e., the lowest half of a
midterm will be dropped).  

<li>
<b>Final Exam:</b> 150 points  
</ul>
<b>Letter grade assignments:</b> Letter grades will be based on the  
total number of points earned at the end of the semester, using 
the standard 90/80/70/60 scale (96% = A+, 93% = A, 90% = A-, etc.),
with possibly some adjustments downward (resulting in a more generous
curve) depending on the overall score distribution in the class.  For example,
if you end up with 540 out of 600 points (i.e., 90%), you are
<b>guaranteed</b> at least an A-; 480/600 points will guarantee at least a B-;
and so on.  The actual cutoffs will likely end up being be more generous,
i.e., more favorable to you! 


<li>
<b>Group work policy:</b>
Group work on the homework problems (excluding bonus/extracredit
problems) is fine and, indeed, encouraged.  If you work with others on the
homework, put the names of the other group members on the problem sheet.
<b>You must write up solutions yourself, using your own words.</b> 

<li>
<b>Missed exams/homework:</b> 
If you miss an exam (or homework) and have a valid excuse, I will mark the
exam/homework as "excused".  Valid excuses include illness, an out-of-town
job interview, etc., and must be appropriately documented, e.g.,
by an <b><a href =
"http://odos.illinois.edu/community-of-care/resources/students/absence-letters/"
> absence letter</a></b> issued by the Office of the Dean of Students, 300
Turner Student Services Building, 610 East John Street.  For more
information click on the above link.

<li>
<b>Attendance.</b> 
I expect you to attend class.  Skipping classes shows a lack of commitment
and disrespect.  The same goes for chatting, texting, or websurfing during
classtime.  I take my duties as instructor seriously and put a lot of
effort into preparing lectures, and I expect students to be respectful of
this effort.

</ul>

Best of luck with this class,
<br>
and have a wonderful summer!
