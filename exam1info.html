<h1> 
Math 347 Midterm Exam 1 Information, Syllabus, and Study Guide
</h1>

<h2>
Basic Information
</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Date/time:</b> The exam will be <b>Wednesday, June 26, 2019, 9 am -
10:10 am</b> in the regular classroom.  You will have 70 minutes for the exam. 

<li>
<b>Rules:</b> No books, notes, formula sheets, etc.  For proofs you should
only use the tools and techniques covered in class.


</ul>



<h2>
Exam Content
</h2>

The exam will be on the material covered in class
through Friday, 6/21; see below for a detailed syllabus.
The exam will have 5-6 problems, generally with several parts.
The questions will be of one of the following types:

<ul>
<li>
<b>Theorems, definitions, logical statements, negations, etc.:</b> 
These are problems that simply ask for an answer (e.g., a precise
statement of a definition), and which should take very little time
if you are prepared.  You must use correct notation and terminology,
supply any necessary quantifiers, in the right order, etc.  As we have
seen in class, small changes in a definition (e.g., changing the order of
quantifiers or using the wrong quantifier) can turn the definition on its
head and completely change its meaning; this can mean the difference
between full credit and no credit on a problem!

<li>
<b>Questions asking for short justification.</b>
Some of the questions may request, in addition to an answer, a brief
justification.  Here usually one or two sentences, rather than a
detailed proof, are all that is expected. 

<li>
<b>
Problems asking for a proof.
</b>
A few of the problems will ask for full-fledged proofs, of the 
type that came up in the homework and the worksheets.
Here, the write-up must include all steps, in
a logically correct sequence, with proper mathematical notation and
terminology, and any necessary quantifiers included, in the same way as
was done in class, in the proof templates and sample proofs on the handouts
and worksheet solutions, and in the homework solutions.  Missing steps, missing
or incorrect quantifiers,  will result in loss of credit.
<p>

</ul>

<b>Homework versus exams:</b>
Most of the homework problems are at a level appropriate for an exam, and
many have been used in exams, and the same goes for most the worksheet
problems.  Thus, reworking the homework and worksheet
problems is an excellent preparation for the exam. 
However, there are some important differences
to keep in mind: First, questions asking to state a theorem or definition
(e.g., the definition of an ``increasing function''),
would not make sense in homework assignments (where you
could just look up the answer in the book), but are perfectly appropriate for an
exam.  Second, a few of the homework problems (e.g., the puzzle
problems from HW 2) would be inappropriate for an exam because 
they are too lengthy or are too nonroutine. Finally, the grading of the
homework is different from that of an exam problem. HW problems are
graded more crudely, and to some extent more generously, than exam
problems. A typical homework problem has scores of 0-2 or 0-3 points, 
whereas an exam problem might have a maximal score of 15 or 20 
points.  Thus, a minor error that would not result in a loss of a point on
a 3 point homework problem might cost a couple of points on a 20 point exam
problem.

<h2>
Syllabus
</h2>

The exam will be on the material covered in class through Friday, 6/21.
In the text, this corresponds to Chapters 1 and 2 plus 
a small part of Chapter 3 (sum/product notations - see below) 
 <b>except</b> for the following:
p. 2-3 (quadratic equation), p. 10-17  (functions, level
sets, real number system), Application 1.14 (p. 8,  Penny Problem), p.  25-26
(Def. 2.1 and Th.  2.2).

<h2>
Advice on Preparing for the Exam
</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Start studying early.</b>
Don't wait till the night before the exam. 

<li>
<b>Find someone, or a group, to study with.</b>
Most students do best when studying together.  

<li>
<b>Prepare a review sheet/cheat sheet.</b> 
Make up a review sheet containing all the results, definitions, terminology,
etc. that you need to know.  The above syllabus can serve as a rough
guide for things you should have on the sheet.  Simply writing
down this material helps committing it to memory, but to get the most 
out of this exercise, make up your first draft of the sheet without
referring to class notes or the book, reconstructing the definitions from
memory as best you can.  Then use the class notes and handouts and the
book to fill in any gaps, compare your definitions to the "official"
ones, and make any corrections necessary. 

<li>
<b>Redo the problems from the worksheets and homework assignments.</b>
Most of the exam problems will be problems of the kind
that have come up in the worksheets and on the homework.  To do well on
the exam you must get comfortable with such problems, be able to
recognize them when they come up, know how to approach them and, in
case of proof problems, know how to properly write up a proof. The best
way to prepare for this is to redo the problems <b>without referring to
the solutions.</b> The latter is a crucial point.  Many students make the
mistake to read over the solutions, think that they understand it, and
then leave it at that.  This gives a false sense  of confidence, and many
end up getting lost if they have to work a problem completely on their
own in an exam situation. Thus, do the problems on your own first, and
use the solutions only to compare and check your work.  A good way to do
this is to download clean copies of the worksheets and hw assignments
<b>without solutions</b> from the course webpage, and do your work on
those clean sheets. 

<li>
<b>
Try to understand the definitions and theorems rather than  
just mechanically memorize them.
</b>
Try to understand how a definition "works",
and why the way it is stated is the "right" way. Ask yourself why the 
quantifiers appear in the given order and why they are of the "right"
type ("for all" versus "exists").  If you understand the "inner workings"
of a definition, it is a lot easier to memorize it and keep it straight,
and it is easier to work with the definition, apply it correctly in
proofs, find its negations, etc.

<li>
<b>
Take advantage of the Open House/Office Hours. 
</b>
I am available each day after class at 11 am (in 147 Altgeld), 
and Wednesdays/Sundays at 4 pm (in 141 Altgeld).  I'm also happy to answer
questions by email (ajh@illinois.edu). However, keep in mind that email is 
best suited for quick questions and clarifications (Do we have to know
...?  Does ... mean the same as ...? Can I use contraposition for this
problem?), while for more complex questions and questions that require an
extended explanations, it is better to ask in person.
