<h1> 
Math 347 Midterm Exam 2 Information, Syllabus, and Study Guide
</h1>

<h2>
Basic Information
</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Date/time:</b> The exam will be <b>Wednesday, July 10, 2019, 9 am -
10:10 am</b> in the regular classroom.  You will have 70 minutes for the exam. 

<li>
<b>Rules:</b> No books, notes, formula sheets, etc.  For proofs you should
only use the tools and techniques covered in class.


</ul>



<h2>
Exam Content
</h2>

The exam will be on the material covered since the first midterm:
Induction (Chapter 3), Functions (Chapter 4 and p. 10-13 of Chapter 1),
Cardinality and Countability (Chapter 4, p. 88 - 90).  The relevant homework
assignments are HW 4 - HW 6.  A detailed syllabus is given below.

<p>
The exam will be similar in length and format to the first midterm: There will
be 5--6 problems, generally with several parts.  The questions
will be a mix of problems asking for straight definitions or statements of
theorems, problems that require a short  answer with a brief justification
(e.g., an example or counterexample), and two or three proof problems.

<h2>
Advice on Preparing for the Exam
</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Start studying early.</b>
Don't wait till the night before the exam. 

<li>
<b>Find someone, or a group, to study with.</b>
Most students do best when studying together.  

<li>
<b>Prepare a review sheet/cheat sheet.</b> 
Make up a review sheet containing all the results, definitions, terminology,
etc. that you need to know.  The above syllabus can serve as a rough
guide for things you should have on the sheet.  Simply writing
down this material helps committing it to memory, but to get the most 
out of this exercise, make up your first draft of the sheet without
referring to class notes or the book, reconstructing the definitions from
memory as best you can.  Then use the class notes and handouts and the
book to fill in any gaps, compare your definitions to the "official"
ones, and make any corrections necessary. 

<li>
<b>Redo the problems from the worksheets and homework assignments.</b>
Most of the exam problems will be problems of the kind
that have come up in the worksheets and on the homework.  To do well on
the exam you must get comfortable with such problems, be able to
recognize them when they come up, know how to approach them and, in
case of proof problems, know how to properly write up a proof. The best
way to prepare for this is to redo the problems <b>without referring to
the solutions.</b> The latter is a crucial point.  Many students make the
mistake to read over the solutions, think that they understand it, and
then leave it at that.  This gives a false sense  of confidence, and many
end up getting lost if they have to work a problem completely on their
own in an exam situation. Thus, do the problems on your own first, and
use the solutions only to compare and check your work.  A good way to do
this is to download clean copies of the worksheets and hw assignments
<b>without solutions</b> from the course webpage, and do your work on
those clean sheets. 

<li>
<b>
Try to understand the definitions and theorems rather than  
just mechanically memorize them.
</b>
Try to understand how a definition "works",
and why the way it is stated is the "right" way. Ask yourself why the 
quantifiers appear in the given order and why they are of the "right"
type ("for all" versus "exists").  If you understand the "inner workings"
of a definition, it is a lot easier to memorize it and keep it straight,
and it is easier to work with the definition, apply it correctly in
proofs, find its negations, etc.

<li>
<b>
Take advantage of the Open House/Office Hours. 
</b>
I am available each day after class at 11 am (in 147 Altgeld), 
and Wednesdays/Sundays at 4 pm (in 141 Altgeld).  I'm also happy to answer
questions by email (ajh@illinois.edu). However, keep in mind that email is 
best suited for quick questions and clarifications (Do we have to know
...?  Does ... mean the same as ...? Can I use contraposition for this
problem?), while for more complex questions and questions that require an
extended explanations, it is better to ask in person.
